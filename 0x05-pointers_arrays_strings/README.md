           0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
           ***************************************
           ---------------------------------------
This project covers the basics of C pointers, arrays and strings
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables

-----------------------------------------------------------------
the following tasks and scripts were used to achieve the above 
1. |0-reset_to_98.c| function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
2. |1-swap.c| function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. |2-strlen.c| function that returns the length of a string.
4. |3-puts.c| Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
5. |4-print_rev.c| function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
6. |5-re_string.c| function that reverses a string.
7. |6-puts2.c| function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
8. |7-puts_half.c| function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
9. |8-print_array.c| function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
10. |9-strcpy.c| function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
11. |10-atoi.c| function that convert a string to an integer.
12. |101-keygen.c| function that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
